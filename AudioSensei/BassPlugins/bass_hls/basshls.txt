What's the point?
=================
BASSHLS is an extension to the BASS audio library, enabling the playing of
HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) streams. Local media playlists and segments are
also supported.


Requirements
============
BASS 2.4 is required (2.4.13 or above is recommended).


Using BASSHLS
=============
The plugin system (see BASS_PluginLoad) can be used to add HLS support to
the standard BASS stream creation functions. Dedicated HLS stream creation
functions are also provided by BASSHLS.

The usage information in the BASS.TXT file (from the BASS package) is also
applicable to BASSHLS and other add-ons.

TIP: The BASSHLS.CHM file should be put in the same directory as the BASS.CHM
     file, so that the BASSHLS documentation can be accessed from within the
     BASS documentation.


Latest Version
==============
The latest versions of BASSHLS & BASS can be found at the BASS website:
