NOTE: You may need to "Unblock" the BASSCD.CHM file in its "Properties" to
      view it on Windows 7. The documentation can also be viewed online at
      the BASS website.

NOTE: To run the example EXEs, first you will have to copy BASSCD.DLL and
      BASS.DLL into the same directory as them.

NOTE: To build the examples, you will need to copy the BASS API into the
      same directory as the BASSCD API.

NOTE: The Delphi and VB examples may not always be up to date with the C
      examples, so the latter should be preferred as references if possible.

What's the point?
=================
BASSCD is an extension to the BASS audio library, enabling the streaming
and ripping of CD audio tracks.


Requirements
============
BASS 2.4 is required.


Using BASSCD
=============
The CD format is used in very much the same way as any of the built-in BASS
stream formats, simply call the CD stream creation function instead of the
standard BASS functions. The BASS plugin system (see BASS_PluginLoad) is also
supported for CDA files on Windows.

The usage information in the BASS.TXT file (from the BASS package) is also
applicable to BASSCD and other add-ons.

TIP: The BASSCD.CHM file should be put in the same directory as the BASS.CHM
     file, so that the BASSCD documentation can be accessed from within the
     BASS documentation.


Latest Version
==============
The latest versions of BASSCD & BASS can be found at the BASS website:
