NOTE: To run the example EXEs, first you will have to copy BASSWMA.DLL and
      BASS.DLL into the same directory as them.

NOTE: To build the examples, you will need to copy the BASS API into the
      same directory as the BASSWMA API.


What's the point?
=================
BASSWMA is an extension to the BASS audio library, enabling the playback
of WMA files and network streams. The audio tracks of WMV files can also
be played. WMA file encoding and network broadcasting functions are also
provided.


Requirements
============
BASS 2.4 is required. The Windows Media Format modules (v9 or above) are
also required to be installed on the user's system. They are installed with
Windows Media player, so will already be on most users' systems, but they
can also be installed separately (WMFDIST.EXE is available from the BASS
website).


Using BASSWMA
=============
The plugin system (see BASS_PluginLoad) can be used to add WMA support to
the standard BASS stream (and sample) creation functions. Dedicated WMA
stream creation functions are also provided by BASSWMA.

The usage information in the BASS.TXT file (from the BASS package) is also
applicable to BASSWMA and other add-ons.

TIP: The BASSWMA.CHM file should be put in the same directory as the BASS.CHM
     file, so that the BASSWMA documentation can be accessed from within the
     BASS documentation.


DRM
===
DRM support is available for commercial users that have a DRM stub library
from Microsoft. Get in touch for details (email: bass@un4seen.com).


Latest Version
==============
The latest versions of BASSWMA & BASS can be found at the BASS website:
