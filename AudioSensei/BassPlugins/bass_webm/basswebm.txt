What's the point?
=================
BASSWEBM is an extension to the BASS audio library, enabling the playing of
WebM and Matroska files.


Requirements
============
BASS 2.4 is required (2.4.13 or above is recommended). The BASSOPUS add-on is
also required for Opus support. Other add-ons may also be required for other
codecs that Matroska files may use (typically AAC or AC3).


Using BASSWEBM
=============
The plugin system (see BASS_PluginLoad) can be used to add WebM support to
the standard BASS stream creation functions. Dedicated WebM stream creation
functions are also provided by BASSWEBM.

The usage information in the BASS.TXT file (from the BASS package) is also
applicable to BASSWEBM and other add-ons.

TIP: The BASSWEBM.CHM file should be put in the same directory as the BASS.CHM
     file, so that the BASSWEBM documentation can be accessed from within the
     BASS documentation.
