What's the point?
=================
BASSDSD is an extension to the BASS audio library, enabling the playing of
DSD (Direct Stream Digital) data in DSDIFF and DSF containers.


Requirements
============
BASS 2.4 is required. BASSASIO can also be used for playback of raw DSD
data. The BASSWV add-on can be used to add support for WavPack DSD files.


Using BASSDSD
=============
The plugin system (see BASS_PluginLoad) can be used to add DSD support to
the standard BASS stream (and sample) creation functions. Dedicated DSD
stream creation functions are also provided by BASSDSD.

The usage information in the BASS.TXT file (from the BASS package) is also
applicable to BASSDSD and other add-ons.

TIP: The BASSDSD.CHM file should be put in the same directory as the BASS.CHM
     file, so that the BASSDSD documentation can be accessed from within the
     BASS documentation.

==============
The latest versions of BASSDSD & BASS can be found at the BASS website:
